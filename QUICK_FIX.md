# Quick Fix for Replit Dependencies Error

You're getting this error because the project has Replit-specific dependencies that don't work on local Mac. Here's the fix:

## Step 1: Use Local Configuration Files
I've created local versions of the config files. Use these commands:

```bash
# Install clean dependencies
rm -rf node_modules
cp package-local.json package.json
npm install
```

## Step 2: Start with Local Config
```bash
node start-local.js
```

## Alternative: Frontend Only Development
If you just want to work on the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts only the frontend at http://localhost:5173

## If Still Having Issues

### Complete Clean Install
```bash
# Delete node_modules folder
rm -rf node_modules

# Delete package-lock.json
rm package-lock.json

# Reinstall everything
npm install

# Install express specifically
npm install express

# Start project
node start.js
```

## What Happened?

When you downloaded the project from Replit, the `node_modules` folder (which contains all dependencies) wasn't included in the ZIP file. This is normal and expected - that's why we need to run `npm install` to download all required packages.

The Express package is essential because it runs the web server that serves your application.

## Expected Result

After running these commands, you should see:
```
serving on port 5000
```

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:5000

## Verification Commands

Check if Express is installed:
```bash
npm list express
```

Check all installed packages:
```bash
npm list --depth=0
```
