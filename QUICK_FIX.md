# Quick Fix for Express Error

You're getting this error because the Express dependency wasn't properly installed. Here's how to fix it:

## Step 1: Fix npm vulnerabilities (safe)
```bash
npm audit fix
```

## Step 2: Install missing Express dependency
```bash
npm install express
```

## Step 3: Start the project
```bash
node start.js
```

## If Still Having Issues

### Complete Clean Install
```bash
# Delete node_modules folder
rm -rf node_modules

# Delete package-lock.json
rm package-lock.json

# Reinstall everything
npm install

# Install express specifically
npm install express

# Start project
node start.js
```

## What Happened?

When you downloaded the project from Replit, the `node_modules` folder (which contains all dependencies) wasn't included in the ZIP file. This is normal and expected - that's why we need to run `npm install` to download all required packages.

The Express package is essential because it runs the web server that serves your application.

## Expected Result

After running these commands, you should see:
```
serving on port 5000
```

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:5000

## Verification Commands

Check if Express is installed:
```bash
npm list express
```

Check all installed packages:
```bash
npm list --depth=0
```
